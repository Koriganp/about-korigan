		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img class="me" src="images/me.JPG" alt="Pic of Me (Korigan Payne)"/>

		<p>This is me. My name is Korigan Payne. I am 37 years old and have lived in
			New Mexico for 13 years. I grew up in Oklahoma and have actually
			lived in 10 states and have been to 37. I have recently left my career
			of twelve years to move into a career I feel is something that more aligns
			with my personality.</p>
		<p>I am married to a wonderful woman (who is an associate at firm in the
			building as the class that I am taking to learn how to write websites,
			like this one) and have a thirteen, soon to be fourteen, year-old son.
			I also have two dogs, two cats, and a lizard.</p>
		<p>I am looking forward to the next 10 weeks as I continue to migrate my
		mindset and talents more into the world of web-design and software engineering.</p>
