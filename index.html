		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img class="me" src="images/me.JPG" alt="Pic of Me (Korigan Payne)"/>

		<p>This is me. My name is Korigan Payne. I am 37 years old and have lived in
			New Mexico for the past 13 years. I grew up in Oklahoma but have
			lived in 10 states and have been to 37. I recently left my career
			of the past twelve years to move into a career field that I feel is
			something that more aligns with my personality. I am extremely excited to
			be moving into the coding world!</p>
		<p>Here is a little about me: <br>
			I am married to a wonderful woman (who is an associate at a law firm in the
			same building as the class that I am taking to learn how to write websites,
			like this one) and have a thirteen, soon to be fourteen, year-old son. I enjoy reading,
			playing video games, watching movies, and coding!! I also have two dogs, two cats,
			and a lizard.</p>
		<p>I am looking forward to the next 10 weeks as I continue to migrate my
			mindset and talents more into the world of web-design and software engineering.</p>
