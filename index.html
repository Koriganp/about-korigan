		<img class="me" src="./images/koriganv2.jpg" alt="Pic of Me (Korigan Payne)"/>

		<p>This is me. My name is Korigan Payne. I am 37 years old and have lived in
			New Mexico for the past 13 years. I grew up in Oklahoma but have
			lived in 10 states and have been to 37. I recently left my career
			of the past twelve years to move into a career field that I feel is
			something that more aligns with my personality. I am extremely excited to
			be moving into the coding world!</p>
		<p class="redtext">Here is a little about me</p>: <br>
		<p>I am married to a wonderful woman (who is an associate at a law firm in the
				same building as the</p>
		<p class = "purpletext">class that I am taking to learn how to write websites,
			like this one) and have a thirteen, soon to be fourteen, year-old son.<p>
			I enjoy reading, playing video games, watching movies, and coding!!
			I also have two dogs, two cats, and a lizard.<img class="me" src="./images/avatar-pic.jpg" alt="Pic of Me (Korigan Payne)"/></p>
		<p>I am looking <p class = "purpletext">forward to the next</p> 10 weeks as I continue to migrate my
		mindset and talents more into the world of
		<p class = "purpletext">web-design</p>
		and software engineering.</p>
